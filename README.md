# MBLNet: Multi-Branch Learning Network for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval

![MBLNet Architecture](./docs/architecture.jpg)

This repository provides the official implementation of **MBLNet**, a novel and highly reliable fine-grained deep hashing learning framework for accurate image retrieval in the presence of significant intra-class variation and small inter-class differences. 

## 🌟 Highlights

- 🔁 We propose a novel and highly reliable fine-grained deep hash learning framework MBLNet, which addresses the issues of fine-grained feature mining, noisy feature filtering and low retrieval accuracy simultaneously.
- ✂️ a Dual-Selected Significant Region Erasure (DSSRE) method to enhance the generation of compact and discriminative binary hash codes.
- 🧭 a Dual Filtering Object Location (DFOL) strategy to mine discriminative local features and focus on object-relevant regions.
- 🔒 a new Multi-Stage Loss Function to guide effective network optimization.
